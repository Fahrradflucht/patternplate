patternplate is a platform designed to help you create and maintain component libraries.


## Prerequisites

patternplate is based on Node.js. Lowest supported version is the current LTS release and
the npm version that ships with it.

*  node `>= 4`
*  npm `>= 3`

## Quickstart

Get up and running with patternplate in three steps. You can find the source of a completed `patternplate init` guide at [getting-started](https://github.com/sinnerschrader/patternplate-getting-started).

```shell
# Grab patternplate from npm
npm install -g patternplate

# Create an initial patternplate setup
patternplate init patternplate-project

# Start patternplate and open in default browser
cd patternplate-project && npm install && npm start -- --open

# Go forth and create, show, deliver
```

## Examples

*  [getting-started](https://sinnerschrader.github.io/patternplate-getting-started/v2.0.0/) - The results of the `patternplate init` guide
*  [patternplate-ui](https://sinnerschrader.github.io/patternplate-ui/) - Next version of patternplate developed in patternplate

## Next steps
