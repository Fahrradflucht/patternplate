# Roadmap

We are far from being done with `patternplate`. See
the lists below for some of the highlights we will work on in the next months.

## Analysis

* Global dependency tree
* Track references between docs and components
* Create screenshots of pattern demos automatically

## Editing 

* A markdown editor
* Live editing of widget code blocks
* Multiple component variants from one demo file
* Embeddable component docs 
* Single file components with `json` and `md` 
* mermaid support

## Integration

* Search on the command line
* Edit this file link for docs and components
* Improved error propagation
* A VSCode-esque Plugin API (Technical Preview)
