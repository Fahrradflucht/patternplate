# Catch and convice with a cover page

> :timer_clock: **Time invest**: 20 Minutes ––– :woman_student: **Level**: Expert


## What to expect

You work dozens of hours on your design system and **of course** you want to brag about it. 

patternplate's design fits well to documentation, but for a landing page it should be a bit more fancy.

This is where the cover feature comes in.


We will …

* … have a look at the necessary configuration for `cover`
* … design a "Hello World" page with vanilla `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript`

## You'll need

* :white_check_mark: You are all set if you followed along [Guide: Build a component](./doc/docs/guides/add-component?guides-enabled=true)

---

* :writing_hand: Text editor
* :file_folder: patternplate project ([Getting Started Guide](./doc/docs/guides/getting-started?guides-enabled=true))

## Before you start

* Have a rough grasp [on Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
* Understand `HTML` and `CSS` on a fundamental level
